Week 1 assignment, Exploratory Data Analysis

ExData_Plotting1 â€“ READ.ME file
#This assignment uses a dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository called Electric power consumption [20Mb].
#The dataset contains measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available. Nine variables charted and listed at the UCI web site include:
1.	Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2.	Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3.	Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4.	Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5.	Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6.	Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7.	Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8.	Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9.	Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
#The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns and missing values are coded as `?`.
#I loaded data and the lubridate R package
#Next, I import in the dataset naming it hpc

> hpc <- read.csv("C:/Users/CA/Downloads/exdata_data_household_power_consumption/household_power_consumption.txt", header=FALSE, sep=";")
#Per the instructions, I used data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02; and I could convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the `strptime()` and `as.Date()` functions. 
#In this assignment, I submit
1.	A GitHub URL containing a git repository
2.	A GitHub repository containing at least one commit beyond the original fork https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1
1.	Here is the clone https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1 
3.	Four plot files in specified graphics file formats
4.	Four plots that correctly display contents per assignment instruction examples
5.	Four sets of R code appear for each Plot numbered 1-4 (so four files)

## Making Plots
#The main goal of the assignment is to examine visually how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in February 2007. 
#To do this, I created four plots using the base plotting system, though I loaded lubridate. 
#After I forked and cloned the assigned GitHub repository (see above), I then constructed the plots
#Each plot was constructed to the following specifications and accompanied files
*Saved as a .png file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
* Named as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.
*Accompanied with separate R code files entitled `plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc. that has (a) code for creating the graphic according to four examples in the assignment, and (b) code for creating the .png file
*Added to the git repository ultimately pushed to GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. 
*Construct final assignment of four .png files and four R code files with a READ.ME file (9 files in total saved into the repository)
